abstract  = {Recent research has shown that multi-modal learning is a successful method for enhancing classification performance by mixing several forms of input, notably in speech-emotion recognition (SER) tasks. However, the difference between the modalities may affect SER performance. To overcome this problem, a novel approach for multi-modal SER called 3M-SER is proposed in this paper. The 3M-SER leverages multi-head attention to fuse information from multiple feature embeddings, including audio and text features. The 3M-SER approach is based on the SERVER approach but includes an additional fusion module that improves the integration of text and audio features, leading to improved classification performance. To further enhance the correlation between the modalities, a LayerNorm is applied to audio features prior to fusion. Our approach achieved an unweighted accuracy (UA) and weighted accuracy (WA) of 79.96{\%} and 80.66{\%}, respectively, on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset. This indicates that the proposed approach is better than SERVER and recent methods with similar approaches. In addition, it highlights the effectiveness of incorporating an extra fusion module in multi-modal learning.},

abstract  = {In recent years, along with the increase in private cars, traffic signs have increased in quantity, demanding greater attentiveness from drivers. Many studies have been conducted on Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) to enhance road safety and driver assistance systems by enabling vehicles to autonomously detect and interpret traffic signs, providing crucial information to drivers in real-time. This paper examines various traffic sign detection and classification models, which give practitioners and researchers valuable insights into selecting optimal solutions tailored to the needs of real-world applications. Notably, the investigation highlights YOLOv8 as a leading detection model, displaying exceptional results with an mAP of 99.4\%. YOLOv8 provides various model sizes allowing for adaptation to specific real-time processing scenarios. On the other hand, the LeNet model is a standout performer in the classification domain, consistently achieving a remarkable accuracy of 98.2\% while using only 0.4 million parameters. The LeNet architecture ensures accurate and rapid traffic sign classification, making it an appealing choice for applications where resource efficiency is critical.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, multi-modal analysis has gained significant prominence across domains such as audio/speech processing, natural language processing, and affective computing, with a particular focus on speech emotion recognition (SER). The integration of data from diverse sources, encompassing text, audio, and images, in conjunction with classifier algorithms has led to the realization of enhanced performance in SER tasks. Traditionally, the cross-entropy loss function has been employed for the classification problem. However, it is challenging to discriminate the feature representations among classes for multi-modal classification tasks. In this study, we focus on the impact of the loss functions on multi-modal SER rather than designing the model architecture. Mainly, we evaluate the performance of multi-modal SER with different loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss, center loss, contrastive-center loss, and their combinations. Based on extensive comparative analysis, it is proven that the combination of cross-entropy loss and contrastive-center loss achieves the best performance for multi-modal SER. This combination reaches the highest accuracy of 80.27\% and the highest balanced accuracy of 81.44\% on the IEMOCAP dataset.},

In this study, we aim to assess a comprehensive set of seven distinct methodologies, including six existing methods from prior research and one newly proposed.

  abstract  = {In the field of image and video colorization, the existing research employs a CNN to extract information from each video frame. However, due to the local nature of a kernel, it is challenging for CNN to capture the relationships between each pixel and others in an image, leading to inaccurate colorization. To solve this issue, we introduce an end-to-end network called Vitexco for colorizing videos. Vitexco utilizes the power of the Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the relationships among all pixels in a frame with each other, providing a more effective method for colorizing video frames. We evaluate our approach on DAVIS datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding color accuracy and visual quality. Our findings suggest that using a ViT can significantly enhance the performance of video colorization.},

  abstract  = {Emotions are an integral part of human communication and interaction, significantly shaping our social connections, decision-making, and overall well-being. Understanding and analyzing emotions have become essential in various fields, including psychology, human-computer interaction, marketing, and healthcare.  The previous approach has indeed made significant strides in improving the accuracy of predicting emotions within speech. However, the current model's performance still falls short when it comes to real-life applications. This limitation arises due to several factors such as lack of context, ambiguity in speech and meaning, and other contributing elements. To reduce the ambiguity of emotions within speech, this paper seeks to leverage multiple data modalities, specifically textual and acoustic information. To analyze these modalities, we propose a novel approach called MERSA which utilizes the self-align method to extract context features from both textual and acoustic information. By leveraging this technique, the MERSA model can effectively create fusion feature vectors of the multiple inputs, facilitating a more accurate and holistic analysis of emotions within speech. Moreover, the MERSA model has incorporated a cross-attention module into its network architecture, which enables the MERSA model to capture and leverage the interdependencies between the textual and acoustic modalities.},

It can move across challenging terrain like walls and rough surfaces, and effectively find lost objects. In this paper, an innovative multi-modal control approach was developed for the Surveillance Spider Robot (SSR) application, integrating voice recognition and hand gesture recognition as control commands. SSR, a six-legged robot, was designed using a Raspberry Pi 4B embedded device, Arduino Uno kit, RC Servo motors (MG996R), 18650 batteries, mini USB microphone (MI-350), Pi camera V1 (OV5647) and PWM generator (PCA9685). The robot can be controlled through voice or hand gesture recognition captured via camera and microphone. SSR is capable of performing ten specific tasks based on these control commands, including forward movement, backward movement, left turns, right turns, complete turns, movements with higher or lower centers of gravity, slow movement, body-hopping, and stopping. The performance evaluation of voice and hand gesture recognition suggested that SSR can be used in real-world applications with an accuracy that exceeds 90\% for the ten specific tasks.},

abstract = {Video colorization represents a compelling domain within the field of Computer Vision. The traditional approach in this field relies on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features from each video frame and employs a recurrent network to learn information between video frames. While demonstrating considerable success in colorization, most traditional CNNs suffer from a limited receptive field size, capturing local information within a fixed-sized window. Consequently, they struggle to directly grasp long-range dependencies or pixel relationships that span large image or video frame areas. To address this limitation, recent advancements in the field have leveraged Vision Transformer (ViT) and their variants to enhance performance. This article introduces Swin Transformer Exemplar-based Video Colorization (SwinTExCo), an end-to-end model for the video colorization process that incorporates the Swin Transformer architecture as the backbone. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The achievements of this research have significant implications for the domain of documentary and history video restoration, contributing to the broader goal of preserving cultural heritage and facilitating a deeper understanding of historical events through enhanced audiovisual materials.},
